# sanctuary

Managed machine-learning model training tool based on [sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred).

The goal: help efficiently find good models via managed experiments.

Status:

- trying to write down the vision and scope of the project
- a few callbacks for integration of Keras with Sacred
- an "egg" of a backend to provide results from MongoDB via REST API

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bzamecnik/sanctuary/wiki) for details.
